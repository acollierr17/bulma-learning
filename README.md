Currently I'm learning more about Node.js and Express using authentication with `express-session` allowing users to log into this site with their Discord account.

What I'm learning here will be later applied to current and future projects of mine (ex. my Discord.js bots). What you see here overtime is not final.

If you find any issues or you even wish to contribute then feel free to do so!
