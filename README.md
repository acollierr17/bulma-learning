# bulma-learning
Currently I'm learning more about Node.js and Express using authentication with `express-session` allowing users to log into this site with their Discord account.

Along with that, I'm learning the CSS Framework called Bulma. I've been implementing a fair bit for the framework throughout this project and as I expand on more things, I'll be implementing more of this framework! Check out more at [bulma.io](https://bulma.io/).

What I'm learning here will be later applied to current and future projects of mine (ex. my Discord.js bots). What you see here overtime is not final.

If you find any issues or you even wish to contribute then feel free to do so!
